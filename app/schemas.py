"""Pydantic request schemas.

Structural problems (missing / wrong-typed fields) are reported by FastAPI
and normalised in main.py.  Cross-field semantic rules are checked in
semantic_validation so the whole request is rejected with explicit codes:

* ``radius`` must be positive;
* ``freq_low`` may not exceed ``freq_high`` (equal is allowed, a single
  frequency);
* ``start_time`` must be strictly earlier than ``end_time``.

These same rules apply both to a new application and to a license scope
adjustment (equipment relocation); the adjustment endpoint reuses the nested
circle / band / time-window models verbatim.
